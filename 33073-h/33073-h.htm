<p>The history of these rhymes is briefly this.&mdash;An
Arm Chair, made many years ago by <span class="smcap">John Letchworth</span>,
for <span class="smcap">Leonard</span> and <span class="smcap">Jane Snowdon</span>, was presented
to the Author, with some information of the
worthies who were wont to visit the estimable
owners; accompanied with an intimation that it
would be a suitable theme for some verses. The
result follows.</p>

<span class="i0">"Here," said the patriarch, no more doomed to range,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or as the past on memory's tablet rose,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Told how King George, as gushed the hidden springs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bowed at her message from the King of kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of deep probations for her Lord she past;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>

<span class="i0">But face to face Truth's message would impart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst love-tipped arrows entered many a heart;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her work was honoured and her labour blessed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Or as the present did her thoughts engage,<br /></span>
